def givens_elimination(*args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
    """
    Zero out a diagonal block of a matrix by series of Givens rotations.
    
        The matrix has the structure::
    
            [ S ]
            [ D ]
    
        Where S is an upper triangular matrix with shape (n, n) and D is a
        diagonal matrix with shape (n, n) with elements from `diag`. This function
        applies Givens rotations to it such that the resulting matrix has zeros
        in place of D.
    
        Array `S` will be modified in-place.
    
        Array `v` of shape (n,) is the part of the full vector with shape (2*n,)::
    
            [ v ]
            [ 0 ]
    
        to which Givens rotations are applied. This array is modified in place,
        such that on exit it contains the first n components of the above
        mentioned vector after rotations were applied.
