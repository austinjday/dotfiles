    bellman_ford(csgraph, directed=True, indices=None, return_predecessors=False,

        Compute the shortest path lengths using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
    
        The Bellman-ford algorithm can robustly deal with graphs with negative
        weights.  If a negative cycle is detected, an error is raised.  For
        graphs without negative edge weights, dijkstra's algorithm may be faster.
    
        .. versionadded:: 0.11.0
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        csgraph : array, matrix, or sparse matrix, 2 dimensions
            The N x N array of distances representing the input graph.
        directed : bool, optional
            If True (default), then find the shortest path on a directed graph:
            only move from point i to point j along paths csgraph[i, j].
            If False, then find the shortest path on an undirected graph: the
            algorithm can progress from point i to j along csgraph[i, j] or
            csgraph[j, i]
        indices : array_like or int, optional
            if specified, only compute the paths for the points at the given
            indices.
        return_predecessors : bool, optional
            If True, return the size (N, N) predecesor matrix
        unweighted : bool, optional
            If True, then find unweighted distances.  That is, rather than finding
            the path between each point such that the sum of weights is minimized,
            find the path such that the number of edges is minimized.
    
        Returns
        -------
        dist_matrix : ndarray
            The N x N matrix of distances between graph nodes. dist_matrix[i,j]
            gives the shortest distance from point i to point j along the graph.
    
        predecessors : ndarray
            Returned only if return_predecessors == True.
            The N x N matrix of predecessors, which can be used to reconstruct
            the shortest paths.  Row i of the predecessor matrix contains
            information on the shortest paths from point i: each entry
            predecessors[i, j] gives the index of the previous node in the
            path from point i to point j.  If no path exists between point
            i and j, then predecessors[i, j] = -9999
    
        Raises
        ------
        NegativeCycleError:
            if there are negative cycles in the graph
    
        Notes
        -----
        This routine is specially designed for graphs with negative edge weights.
        If all edge weights are positive, then Dijkstra's algorithm is a better
        choice.

        Parameters
        ----------
        csgraph : array, matrix, or sparse matrix, 2 dimensions
            The N x N array of non-negative distances representing the input graph.
        directed : bool, optional
            If True (default), then find the shortest path on a directed graph:

        indices : array_like or int, optional
            if specified, only compute the paths for the points at the given
            indices.
        return_predecessors : bool, optional
            If True, return the size (N, N) predecesor matrix
        unweighted : bool, optional
            If True, then find unweighted distances.  That is, rather than finding
            the path between each point such that the sum of weights is minimized,
            find the path such that the number of edges is minimized.
        limit : float, optional
            The maximum distance to calculate, must be >= 0. Using a smaller limit
            will decrease computation time by aborting calculations between pairs
            that are separated by a distance > limit. For such pairs, the distance
            will be equal to np.inf (i.e., not connected).
    
            .. versionadded:: 0.14.0
    
        Returns
        -------
        dist_matrix : ndarray
            The matrix of distances between graph nodes. dist_matrix[i,j]
            gives the shortest distance from point i to point j along the graph.
    
        predecessors : ndarray
            Returned only if return_predecessors == True.
            The matrix of predecessors, which can be used to reconstruct
            the shortest paths.  Row i of the predecessor matrix contains
            information on the shortest paths from point i: each entry

            i and j, then predecessors[i, j] = -9999
    
        Notes
        -----
        As currently implemented, Dijkstra's algorithm does not work for
        graphs with direction-dependent distances when directed == False.
        i.e., if csgraph[i,j] and csgraph[j,i] are not equal and
        both are nonzero, setting directed=False will not yield the correct
        result.
    
        Also, this routine does not work for graphs with negative
        distances.  Negative distances can lead to infinite cycles that must
        be handled by specialized algorithms such as Bellman-Ford's algorithm
        or Johnson's algorithm.

        csgraph : array, matrix, or sparse matrix, 2 dimensions
            The N x N array of distances representing the input graph.
        method : string ['auto'|'FW'|'D'], optional
            Algorithm to use for shortest paths.  Options are:
    
               'auto' -- (default) select the best among 'FW', 'D', 'BF', or 'J'
                         based on the input data.
    
               'FW'   -- Floyd-Warshall algorithm.  Computational cost is
                         approximately ``O[N^3]``.  The input csgraph will be
                         converted to a dense representation.
    
               'D'    -- Dijkstra's algorithm with Fibonacci heaps.  Computational
                         cost is approximately ``O[N(N*k + N*log(N))]``, where
    		     ``k`` is the average number of connected edges per node.
    		     The input csgraph will be converted to a csr
    		     representation.
    
               'BF'   -- Bellman-Ford algorithm.  This algorithm can be used when
                         weights are negative.  If a negative cycle is encountered,

                         approximately ``O[N(N^2 k)]``, where ``k`` is the average
                         number of connected edges per node. The input csgraph will
                         be converted to a csr representation.
    
               'J'    -- Johnson's algorithm.  Like the Bellman-Ford algorithm,
                         Johnson's algorithm is designed for use when the weights
                         are negative.  It combines the Bellman-Ford algorithm
                         with Dijkstra's algorithm for faster computation.
    
        directed : bool, optional
            If True (default), then find the shortest path on a directed graph:
            only move from point i to point j along paths csgraph[i, j].
            If False, then find the shortest path on an undirected graph: the
            algorithm can progress from point i to j along csgraph[i, j] or

        overwrite : bool, optional
            If True, overwrite csgraph with the result.  This applies only if
            method == 'FW' and csgraph is a dense, c-ordered array with

        Sparse matrices can be used in arithmetic operations: they support
        addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and matrix power.
    
        Advantages of the CSR format
          - efficient arithmetic operations CSR + CSR, CSR * CSR, etc.
          - efficient row slicing
          - fast matrix vector products
    
        Disadvantages of the CSR format
          - slow column slicing operations (consider CSC)
          - changes to the sparsity structure are expensive (consider LIL or DOK)
