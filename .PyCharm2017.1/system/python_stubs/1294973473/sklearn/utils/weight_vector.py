class WeightVector(object):
    """
    Dense vector represented by a scalar and a numpy array.
    
        The class provides methods to ``add`` a sparse vector
        and scale the vector.
        Representing a vector explicitly as a scalar times a
        vector allows for efficient scaling operations.
    
        Attributes
        ----------
        w : ndarray, dtype=double, order='C'
            The numpy array which backs the weight vector.
        aw : ndarray, dtype=double, order='C'
            The numpy array which backs the average_weight vector.
        w_data_ptr : double*
            A pointer to the data of the numpy array.
        wscale : double
            The scale of the vector.
        n_features : int
            The number of features (= dimensionality of ``w``).
        sq_norm : double
            The squared norm of ``w``.
