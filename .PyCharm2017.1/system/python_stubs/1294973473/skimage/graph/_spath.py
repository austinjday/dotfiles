        Find minimum-difference paths through an n-d costs array.
    
        See the documentation for MCP for full details. This class differs from
        MCP in that the cost of a path is not simply the sum of the costs along
        that path.
    
        This class instead assumes that the cost of moving from one point to
        another is the absolute value of the difference in the costs between the
        two points.
