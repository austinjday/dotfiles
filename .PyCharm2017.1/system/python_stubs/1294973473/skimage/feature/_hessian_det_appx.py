    Computes the approximate Hessian Determinant over an image.
    
        This method uses box filters over integral images to compute the
        approximate Hessian Determinant as described in [1]_.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        img : array
            The integral image over which to compute Hessian Determinant.
        sigma : float
            Standard deviation used for the Gaussian kernel, used for the Hessian
            matrix
    
        Returns
        -------
        out : array
            The array of the Determinant of Hessians.

        Notes
        -----
        The running time of this method only depends on size of the image. It is
        independent of `sigma` as one would expect. The downside is that the
        result for `sigma` less than `3` is not accurate, i.e., not similar to
        the result obtained if someone computed the Hessian and took it's
        determinant.
