def _seam_carve_v(*args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
    """
    Carve vertical seams off an image.
    
        Carves out vertical seams from an image while using the given energy map to
        decide the importance of each pixel.[1]_
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        img : (M, N) or (M, N, 3) ndarray
            Input image whose vertical seams are to be removed.
        energy_map : (M, N) ndarray
            Cost array denoting importance of each pixel. The algorithm will try to
            retain high valued pixels.
        iters : int
            Number of vertical seams to be removed.
        border : int, optional
            The number of pixels in the right, left and bottom end of the image
            to be excluded from being considered for a seam. This is important as
            certain filters just ignore image boundaries and set them to `0`.
            By default border is set to `1`.
    
        Returns
        -------
        image : (M, N - iters, 3) ndarray of float
            The cropped image with the vertical seams removed.
